# Does God Exists?

> **فَاعۡلَمۡ اَنَّهٗ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ** وَاسۡتَغۡفِرۡ لِذَنۡۢبِكَ وَلِلۡمُؤۡمِنِيۡنَ وَ الۡمُؤۡمِنٰتِ​ ؕ وَاللّٰهُ يَعۡلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمۡ وَمَثۡوٰٮكُمۡ‏ ١٩
> Know with certainty that there is no deity except Allahh... — Muhammad 19

- Humans have enough faculty to know that there is no other deities except Allahh.
- It would've been a circular reasoning to use the Qur'an as a proof that God exists.

## In a dice, there are six possible outcomes and if I expected an outcome, the possibility of it happening is 1/6.

#### 2 Dice (2, 4)
- No. of possibilities = $6 × 6 = 36$
- Probability = $\frac{1}{36}$

#### 3 Dice (1, 5, 6)
- No. of possibilities = $36 × 6 = 216$
- Probability = $\frac{1}{216}$

#### 4 Dice
- No. of possibilities = $6 × 6 × 6 × 6 = 1296$
- Probability = $\frac{1}{1296}$

### The smaller the probability = The less likely it is a coincidence

#### 10 Dice
- No. of possibilities ≈ $60,000,000$
- Probability ≈ $\frac{1}{60,000,000}$

#### 1000 Dice
- No. of possibilities = $14 × 10^{777}$
- Probability = $\frac{1}{14×10^{777}}$

## A living organism that has 10 cells

- Each cells only has 6 possible way of functioning.
- No. of possibilities = $6^{10} = 60,466,176$

## Human being

- Has 10 trillion cells.
- In general, every human being born functioning exactly the same way.

### There is a repeatability, therefore it cannot be a coincidence.
