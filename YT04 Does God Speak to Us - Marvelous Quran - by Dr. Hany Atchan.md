# Does God Speak to Us?

## Yes!

- Allahh Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala is very close to us. All we have to do is look toward Him, seek Him, talk to Him. He's with us all the time.

>هُوَ الَّذِىۡ خَلَقَ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَالۡاَرۡضَ فِىۡ سِتَّةِ اَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسۡتَوٰى عَلَى الۡعَرۡشِ​ؕ يَعۡلَمُ مَا يَلِجُ فِى الۡاَرۡضِ وَمَا يَخۡرُجُ مِنۡهَا وَمَا يَنۡزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعۡرُجُ فِيۡهَاؕ **وَهُوَ مَعَكُمۡ اَيۡنَ مَا كُنۡتُمۡ**​ؕ وَاللّٰهُ بِمَا تَعۡمَلُوۡنَ بَصِيۡرٌ‏ ٤
>He is with you wherever you are — Al-Hadeed 4

- Allahh is described in the Quran as "Ar-Rahman". Ar-Rahman is The Sustainer — not only He is The Creator, He is constantly in contact and in touch and aware of His creatures and in full contact and communication with them all the time.
- There are so many different ways to speak to God and to listen to God. One obvious way is through His creation. But there are more direct ways to listen to God. All we had to do is to really pay attention. He's always talking to us through our life's conscience if our conscience is not mute.

>وَاِذَا سَاَلَـكَ عِبَادِىۡ عَنِّىۡ فَاِنِّىۡ قَرِيۡبٌؕ اُجِيۡبُ دَعۡوَةَ الدَّاعِ اِذَا دَعَانِ فَلۡيَسۡتَجِيۡبُوۡا لِىۡ وَلۡيُؤۡمِنُوۡا بِىۡ لَعَلَّهُمۡ يَرۡشُدُوۡنَ‏ ١٨٦
>If my human creatures ask me about me, indeed I am near. I answer the call of any who invite me. Let them, therefore, respond to me and believe in me perchance they shall be guided — Al-Baqarah 186

- All you have to do is to enter into the Quran with your own conviction, into the realm of discovering the Quran with virgin eyes, with ready and wandering mind, and conviction that God shall guide you.
